                    <p> <strong>Hi, I'm Jonathan.</strong> I'm a student at Yale University double majoring in Computer Science and Statistics & Data Science. In the past, I've worked as a software engineering intern at Beagle Learning and a researcher at the Broad Institute.
                    As an avid programmer, I firmly believe in technologyâ€™s ability to empower curious and motivated individuals to tackle real-world problems. From autonomous vehicles to cutting-edge language models, my fascination with programming only deepens by the day, pushing me to continue learning, exploring, and creating.

                    <p>In my free time, I also enjoy 3-D printing trinkets for my desk, playing board games with friends, or relaxing to lofi hip-hop beats. </p>
